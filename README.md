<h1>Marvya Navbar Project Submission</h1>
<p>This repository contains my submission for the Marvya Frontend Test, where I was tasked with creating a responsive and interactive navigation bar using only plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

<h3>Project Structure</h3>
<p>The project consists of three main files:</p>

<ul>
```index.html``` - the markup for the navigation bar.
```styles.css``` - the styling rules for the navbar, ensuring it is visually appealing and responsive.
```main.js``` - the JavaScript code that adds interactivity to the navigation bar, such as dropdowns and responsive toggles.
</ul>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> The navigation bar is fully responsive and adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.</li>
<li><strong>Dropdown Menus:</strong> top-level navigation item includes a dropdown menu, activated on hover for desktop and on click for mobile devices.</li>
</ul>

<h4>During the development process, I emphasized clean code and best practices. Here's a brief overview of my approach:</h4>
<p>
I started with a mobile-first design strategy, ensuring that the navigation experience is optimized for smaller screens before scaling up to larger devices.
For CSS, I used a systematic approach, starting with base element styles and gradually adding complexity with media queries and pseudo-classes for interactivity.
</p>

<h4>Challenges Faced</h4>
<p>One challenge I faced was ensuring the dropdown menus were both aesthetically pleasing and functional across all devices. I overcame this by careful planning of the CSS rules and thorough testing on various devices.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>I am confident that this navigation bar meets the requirements set out in the project brief and provides a user-friendly experience. I look forward to any feedback from the Marvya team and am happy to make any necessary adjustments.</p>

<p>Thank you for considering my submission.</p>
